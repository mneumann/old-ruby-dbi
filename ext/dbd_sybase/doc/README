This is a sample Sybase driver for Rainer Perl's DBI-for-Ruby.

It is based on (and requires) "FreeTDS" http://www.freetds.org/


Supported column-types
======================

SYBCHAR, SYBVARCHAR, SYBBIT, SYBINTN, SYBINT1, SYBINT2, SYBINT4, SYBFLTN,
SYBDATETIMN, SYBDATETIME, SYBFLT8

Please note that I only did very basic tests! If you feel like writing
a test-suite - great, I'd love that :o)

Note to SYBDATETIME/SYBDATETIMN: This returns, for example '2.1000' which means
2 days_since_1900-01-01, 1000 ms_since_00:00:00.000.


ToDo
====

Although I wanted to release a driver that supports all 29 column-types
on 2001/05/05, this didn't happen. It's a little tricky...

However, you can expect that this driver is constantly improved. Since I use
it in the office, I am usually adding things to it Mo-Fr and release a new
version on the weekend.
