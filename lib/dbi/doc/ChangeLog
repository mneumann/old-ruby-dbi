: 0.0.16 (2002-07-03)

* dbd_pg: Added Statement#fetch_scroll (patch by Stephen Davies).

* dbi: Added StatementHandle#[] and #[]=. Updated DBI and DBD specs.

* dbd_pg: Fixed semantic of method Statement#rows (affects also Database#do): 
  Now returns the Row Processed Count instead of the number of rows in the result. 
  The old behaviour is still available through method Statement#['pg_row_count']. 

* changed license from GNU GPL to BSD

: 0.0.15 (2002-05-21)

: 0.0.14 (2002-05-14)

* dbd_mysql: fixed bug: method #do and #execute both set query_with_result of 
  the same underlying database object. This results in errors if you mix both 
  method calls (not neccessarily called concurrently). Solution: Mutex.
 
* dbd_pg: cache calls to PGResult#result in class Tuples (patch by James
  F.Hranicky); increase performance of a factor around 100
