[[partially obsolete -> rewrite]]
What is it?
===========

This is a DBI-for-Ruby. It is designed to behave like the DBI you know from
Perl.

The following works:

DBI.connect
dbh.do
dbh.prepare
sth.execute
sth.fetchrow_array
sth.fetchrow_arrayref
sth.fetchrow_hashref
dbh.quote
sth.name (as in $sth->{NAME})
sth.num_of_fields ($sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS})

And, as an extension to Perl's DBI:
dbh.lastDoDur (= duration of last dbh.do)
sth.lastExecDur (= duration of last sth.execute)
...but don't expect this to be useful, I only implemented it to do some
rough performance-tests.

Ugly example-code:

--snip--
require 'dbi'

dbh = DBI.connect('DBI:mysql:test', 'testuser', 'testpwd')

puts "inserting..."
execTime=0
1.upto(13) do |i|
 dbh.do("insert into simple01 (SongName, SongLength_s) VALUES ('Song #
{i}', #{i*10});")
 execTime+=dbh.lastDoDur
end 
puts "Loop Execution-time was #{execTime} seconds."

puts "selecting..."
sth=dbh.prepare('select * from simple01')
sth.execute
puts "Execution-time was #{sth.lastExecDur} seconds."

while dat=sth.fetchrow_hashref do
 puts dat.inspect
end

puts "deleting..."
dbh.do('delete from simple01 where internal_id > 10')
puts "Execution-time was #{dbh.lastDoDur} seconds."

dbh.disconnect
--snip--

If you want to write drivers for this DBI, please see the homepage for details.
