= ToDo

* columns / column_info with more DBDs (DB2, Oracle, Interbase, ODBC)
* Tainting
* table_info
* bind_param_inout
* type_info / type_info_all
* bind_col ?
* Rewrite DBI-dispatching in C?
* fetch_many callable as iterator
* warn if commit/rollback and AutoCommit is on
* bind_out_param/bind_inout_param
* tracing/logging for DBDs by calling log(...)
* define exact behaviour of fetch_scroll
* define exact behaviour of exception classes
* do not pass *args paramters to DBD (it's harder for C-extensions to handle them)

= Done

* get a Driver object, call methods on it
* blob_import etc for DBD::Pg
* parameter markers in DB2
