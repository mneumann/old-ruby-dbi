Ruby DBI FrontBase Driver version 0.5.2
=========================================

This is an implementation of the ruby-dbi driver for the FrontBase
data base.

Warning: This software is very experimental. The ruby DBI interface
is still a moving target.

See the following URL's for required software ...

Ruby DBI:
    http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/

DBI Spec:
    http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/DBI_SPEC.html

DBD Spec:
    http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/DBD_SPEC.html

Installation
============

    A bit of configuration is needed to move the driver to the
    ruby-dbi-all package. 

        cp -r ruby-frontbase/dbd_frontbase ruby-dbi-all/lib/
        cd ruby-dbi-all
    
        cat >> lib/PATHCONV
        dbd_frontbase dbd_frontbase DBD/FrontBase
        CTRL-D

    Install like every DBD.
    
        ruby setup.rb config --with=dbd_frontbase
        ruby setup.rb setup
        sudo ruby setup.rb install
  
Unit Tests
==========

There are unit tests available, but currently they depend on a
pre-existing database on my machine.  Future versions will remove that
dependency.  To run the tests, type "make test".
