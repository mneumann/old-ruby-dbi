What is it?
===========

This is a DBI-for-Ruby. It is designed to behave like the DBI you know from
Perl.

I've supplied the following drivers in this package:

MySQL
Sybase

Please see
 lib/dbi/doc/README
 lib/dbd_mysql/doc/README
 ext/dbd_sybase/doc/README
for additional information and
 examples/*
for ... examples :o)

If you want to write drivers for this DBI, please see the homepage for details.

You need to have the following installed:

For dbd_mysql: The "MySQL Ruby Module"
 by TOMITA Masahiro <tommy@tmtm.org> http://www.tmtm.org/mysql/

For dbd_sybase: "FreeTDS" http://www.freetds.org/


ToDo
====

The next release will - at least - include the following:

.) Better Sybase-driver (some column-types are still unsupported!)
.) An implementation of Jim Weirich's DbRow


Installation
============

If your FreeTDS-package is not in /usr/local/freetds, you need to edit
ext/dbd_sybase/extconf.rb

Do ruby setup.rb config
   ruby setup.rb setup
   ruby setup.rb install


Problems
========

If you should have problems using dbd_sybase (e.g. "Unable to load driver
'sybase' - check driver-installation (1)" mesage during DBI.connect), try
"require 'dbi/dbd_sybase'" in your source. This may lead to a "libtds.so.0:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - 
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.6/i586-linux/dbi/dbd_sybase.so (LoadError)" and
therefore indicate that you did not add /usr/local/freetds/lib to your
/etc/ld.so.conf (this happend to me when I tested the distribution :o) ).
Also remember to run ldconfig after changing ld.so.conf...

There is also a mailing-list for DBI-specific discussions, see

I'd be happy to hear about the improvements you make or any comments you
might have.
