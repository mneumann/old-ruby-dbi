== Database Drivers (DBDs)

* ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) ((*(dbd_ado)*))

  depend on WinOLE from RAA.

  depend on Michael Neumann's Ruby/DB2 Module, available from RAA.

* InterBase ((*(dbd_interbase)*))

  depend on the InterBase module available from RAA.

* mSQL ((*(dbd_msql)*))

  depend on the Ruby/ODBC (version >= 0.5) binding by Christian Werner <chw@ch-werner.de> 
  ((<URL:http://www.ch-werner.de/rubyodbc>)) or available from the RAA. 
  Works also together with unixODBC. To use the 'odbc_ignorecase' option you need Ruby/ODBC >= 0.9.3.

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=postgres>))

* Proxy/Server ((*(dbd_proxy)*))

  depend on distributed Ruby (DRb) available from RAA.

* SQLite ((*(dbd_sqlite)*))

  depend only on the SQLite C-library from: ((<URL:http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/>>)).

* SQLRelay ((*(dbd_sqlrelay)*))

  depend on the Ruby library of SQLRelay: ((<URL:http://www.firstworks.com/sqlrelay/>)).

* Sybase ((*(dbd_sybase)*))
  
  this DBD is currently outdated and will ((*not*)) work with DBI versions > 0.0.4 !!! 


== ChangeLog

See ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/dbi/dbi/ChangeLog.html>)).

== ToDo

See ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/dbi/dbi/ToDo.html>)).


== Download

If you're running FreeBSD or NetBSD, have a look at their package collections. FreeBSD has for DBI and each DBD an easy to
install package, NetBSD currently only for PostgreSQL but more is to come.

A NetBSD package for MySQL is available from at ((<URL:http://www.fantasy-coders.de/ruby/ruby-mysql-2.4.tar.gz>)).

Latest development snapshot available at ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-current.tar.gz>)).

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.11

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.11.tar.gz>))

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.10

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.10.tar.gz>))

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.9

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.9.tar.gz>))

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.8

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.8.tar.gz>))

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.7

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.7.tar.gz>))

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.6.tar.gz>))

: Ruby/DBI 0.0.5

  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/downloads/dbi/ruby-dbi-all-0.0.5.tar.gz>))


== Installation

All available DBDs come with this package, but you should only
install the DBDs you really need.

=== To install all:

   ruby setup.rb config
   ruby setup.rb setup
   ruby setup.rb install

=== To install dbi and some DBDs:

   ruby setup.rb config --with=dbi,dbd_pg....
   ruby setup.rb setup
   ruby setup.rb install

Choose the packages to install by specifing them after the option (({--with})).


== Mailing List
There is also a mailing-list for DBI-specific discussions, see
((<URL:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ruby-dbi-talk>))

== Documentation

See the directories lib/*/doc or ext/*/doc for DBI and DBD specific informations.

The DBI specification is lib/dbi/doc/DBI_SPEC or lib/dbi/doc/html/DBI_SPEC.html or available
from WWW at ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/dbi/dbi/DBI_SPEC.html>)).

The DBD specification (how to write a database driver) is lib/dbi/doc/DBD_SPEC or lib/dbi/doc/html/DBD_SPEC.html or available
from WWW at ((<URL:http://www.ruby-projects.org/dbi/dbi/DBD_SPEC.html>)).


== Examples

Examples can be found in the examples/ subdirectory.
There is e.g. sqlsh.rb, which is an interactive SQL shell similar to Perl's dbish.rb.
Further there is in this directory the file proxyserver.rb which has to be run if you use the DBD::Proxy, 
to access databases remote over a TCP/IP network. 

=== A simple example
  require 'dbi'

  # connect to a datbase
  dbh = DBI.connect('DBI:Mysql:test', 'testuser', 'testpwd')

  puts "inserting..."
  1.upto(13) do |i|
     sql = "insert into simple01 (SongName, SongLength_s) VALUES (?, ?)"
     dbh.do(sql, "Song #{i}", "#{i*10}")
  end 

  puts "selecting..."
  sth=dbh.prepare('select * from simple01')
  sth.execute

  while row=sth.fetch do
   p row
  end

  puts "deleting..."
  dbh.do('delete from simple01 where internal_id > 10')

  dbh.disconnect

=== The same using Ruby's features

  require 'dbi'

  DBI.connect('DBI:Mysql:test', 'testuser', 'testpwd') do | dbh |

    puts "inserting..."
    sql = "insert into simple01 (SongName, SongLength_s) VALUES (?, ?)"
    dbh.prepare(sql) do | sth | 
      1.upto(13) { |i| sth.execute("Song #{i}", "#{i*10}") }
    end 

    puts "selecting..."
    dbh.select_all('select * from simple01') do
      p row
    end

    puts "deleting..."
    dbh.do('delete from simple01 where internal_id > 10')

  end

=end
