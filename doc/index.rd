== Database Drivers (DBDs)

* ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) ((*(dbd_ado)*))

  depend on WinOLE from RAA.

* DB2 ((*(dbd_db2)*))

  depend on Michael Neumann's Ruby/DB2 Module, available from RAA.

* InterBase ((*(dbd_interbase)*))

  depend on the InterBase module available from RAA.

* mSQL ((*(dbd_msql)*))

  depend on the "mSQL Library" by DATE Ken available from the RAA.

* MySQL ((*(dbd_mysql)*))

  depend on the "MySQL Ruby Module" by TOMITA Masahiro <tommy@tmtm.org> ((<URL:http://www.tmtm.org/mysql/>)) or
  available from the RAA.

* ODBC ((*(dbd_odbc)*))

  depend on the Ruby/ODBC (version >= 0.5) binding by Christian Werner <chw@ch-werner.de> 
  ((<URL:http://www.ch-werner.de/rubyodbc>)) or available from the RAA. 
  Works also together with unixODBC. To use the 'odbc_ignorecase' option you need Ruby/ODBC >= 0.9.3.

* Oracle ((*(dbd_oracle)*))

  depend on the "Oracle 7 Module for Ruby" version 0.2.11 by Yoshida Masato, available from RAA. Works fine with Oracle 8/8i.

* PostgreSQL ((*(dbd_pg)*))

  depend on Noboru Saitou's Postgres Package:
  ((<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=postgres>))

* Proxy/Server ((*(dbd_proxy)*))

  depend on distributed Ruby (DRb) available from RAA.

* SQLite ((*(dbd_sqlite)*))

  depend only on the SQLite C-library from: ((<URL:http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/>)).

* SQLRelay ((*(dbd_sqlrelay)*))

  depend on the Ruby library of SQLRelay: ((<URL:http://www.firstworks.com/sqlrelay/>)).

* Sybase ((*(dbd_sybase)*))
  
  this DBD is currently outdated and will ((*not*)) work with DBI versions > 0.0.4 !!! 


== ChangeLog

See ((<URL:http://ruby-dbi.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog.html>)).

== ToDo

See ((<URL:http://ruby-dbi.sourceforge.net/ToDo.html>)).


== Download

Ruby/DBI is available for from the ((<SourceForge project page|URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=43737>)).

If you're running FreeBSD or NetBSD, have a look at their package collections. FreeBSD has for DBI and each DBD an easy to
install package, NetBSD currently only for PostgreSQL but more is to come.

A NetBSD package for MySQL is available at ((<URL:http://www.fantasy-coders.de/ruby/ruby-mysql-2.4.tar.gz>)).

== Installation

All available DBDs come with this package, but you should only
install the DBDs you really need.

=== To install all:

   ruby setup.rb config
   ruby setup.rb setup
   ruby setup.rb install

=== To install dbi and some DBDs:

   ruby setup.rb config --with=dbi,dbd_pg....
   ruby setup.rb setup
   ruby setup.rb install

Choose the packages to install by specifing them after the option (({--with})).


== Mailing List
A mailinglist for DBI-specific discussions is available from the ((<SourceForge project page|URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/ruby-dbi>)).

Our former mailing-list was at ((<URL:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ruby-dbi-talk>)); 
please, don't use it!

== Documentation

See the directories lib/*/doc or ext/*/doc for DBI and DBD specific informations.

The DBI specification is lib/dbi/doc/DBI_SPEC or lib/dbi/doc/html/DBI_SPEC.html or available
from WWW at ((<URL:http://ruby-dbi.sourceforge.net/DBI_SPEC.html>)).

The DBD specification (how to write a database driver) is lib/dbi/doc/DBD_SPEC or lib/dbi/doc/html/DBD_SPEC.html or available
from WWW at ((<URL:http://ruby-dbi.sourceforge.net/DBD_SPEC.html>)).


== Applications

=== sqlsh.rb
The SQL command line interpreter sqlsh.rb is available in directory bin/commandline.
It gets installed by default.

== Examples

Examples can be found in the examples/ subdirectory.
In this directory there is the file proxyserver.rb which has to be run if you use the DBD::Proxy, 
to access databases remote over a TCP/IP network. 

=== A simple example
  require 'dbi'

  # connect to a datbase
  dbh = DBI.connect('DBI:Mysql:test', 'testuser', 'testpwd')

  puts "inserting..."
  1.upto(13) do |i|
     sql = "insert into simple01 (SongName, SongLength_s) VALUES (?, ?)"
     dbh.do(sql, "Song #{i}", "#{i*10}")
  end 

  puts "selecting..."
  sth=dbh.prepare('select * from simple01')
  sth.execute

  while row=sth.fetch do
   p row
  end

  puts "deleting..."
  dbh.do('delete from simple01 where internal_id > 10')

  dbh.disconnect

=== The same using Ruby's features

  require 'dbi'

  DBI.connect('DBI:Mysql:test', 'testuser', 'testpwd') do | dbh |

    puts "inserting..."
    sql = "insert into simple01 (SongName, SongLength_s) VALUES (?, ?)"
    dbh.prepare(sql) do | sth | 
      1.upto(13) { |i| sth.execute("Song #{i}", "#{i*10}") }
    end 

    puts "selecting..."
    dbh.select_all('select * from simple01') do | row |
      p row
    end

    puts "deleting..."
    dbh.do('delete from simple01 where internal_id > 10')

  end
