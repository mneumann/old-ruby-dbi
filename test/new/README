TC_Common contains the basic testing methods that are included by all
other test cases.

Test cases are named TC_#{dbdname}, e.g. TC_SQLite. Every test case
includes TC_Common and inherits from Test::Unit::TestCase. A test case
implements at least the "connect" method, but may overwrite/add methods
as needed.

It might make sense to create other includable modules like
TC_Transactions.
